HYPOTHESIS TEST RESULTS
=======================

1. Normality Test (Shapiro-Wilk on Total_Sales)
-----------------------------------------------
Statistic: 0.8989
p-value: 0.00000126
Result: Reject H0 → Total_Sales is NOT normally distributed.

2. T-test (North vs South Sales)
--------------------------------
t-statistic: 0.130
p-value: 0.8972
Result: Fail to reject H0 → No significant difference in average sales between North and South regions.

3. ANOVA (North, South, East Sales)
-----------------------------------
F-statistic: 0.0509
p-value: 0.9504
Result: Fail to reject H0 → No significant difference in sales across North, South, and East regions.

Summary:
--------
- Regional sales differences are not statistically significant.
- Sales distribution is not normal (skewed by high-value transactions).
- Business implication: Regional strategies may not need differentiation; focus on product-level drivers (Quantity and Price).
